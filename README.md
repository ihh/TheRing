# The Ring

No matter what horrors await you
<br>
I hope you remember one thing
<br>
The courage I feel
<br>
With you as my shield
<br>
Watching The Ring

You were too small to remember
<br>
So that's why we watched it again
<br>
And that's when I knew
<br>
I'd passed it to you
<br>
You're part of The Ring

She's climbing from the well
<br>
She's climbing out of Hell
<br>
But you can't even tell
<br>
Our lives are hers

I hope you find
<br>
Someone else to hide behind
<br>
A fresh uncorrupted mind
<br>
To pass on the curse
